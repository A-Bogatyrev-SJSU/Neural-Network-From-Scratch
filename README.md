# Neural Network Implementation with NumPy

This project contains a simple neural network implemented from scratch using only NumPy and matplotlib for visualization. The neural network comes with three examples:

1. **NeuralNetwork.py**: The main implementation of the neural network.

2. **XOR.py**: Demonstrates training the neural network to solve the XOR problem.

3. **SIN.py**: Trains a neural network to approximate the sin function of four variables combined together, each in the range of -1 to 1.

4. **LetterRecognition.py**: Trains a classifier using the neural network based on the [Letter Recognition dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/59/letter+recognition) from UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Files

### NeuralNetwork.py

This file contains the implementation of the neural network. It includes the necessary functions for initializing the network, forward propagation, backward propagation (backpropagation), and training using gradient descent.

### XOR.py

Demonstrates how to use the neural network to solve the XOR problem. It includes data preparation, training, and evaluation of the trained model.

### SIN.py

Illustrates training the neural network to approximate the sin function of four variables combined together. The variables are within the range of -1 to 1. The file includes data generation, training, and visualization of the results.

### LetterRecognition.py

Utilizes the neural network to train a classifier on the Letter Recognition dataset. It involves model training and evaluation.
